================================================================
Tasks Accomplished:

1. 1 seeder 1 leacher: Standard client protocol implemented which supports 1 seeder and 1 leecher.
2. 1 seeder N leechers: Standard client protocol implemented which supports 1 seeder and N leechers.
3. N seeder N leechers: Standard client protocol implemented which supports N seeders and N leechers.
4. Additionally logging at the seeder end is implemented.
================================================================

Steps to compile and run:

1. Navigate to the directory where the makefile and the source code file is present. Make sure they are present at the same
   location.

2. Type make and hit enter. Step 1 and 2 to be followed on both client and server machines.

3. If no error is displayed, run the following command to run the seeder:
   ./bt .torrent file -b seederip:port [-v]

   for leechers:
   ./bt .torrent file -p seederip:port [-v] -s outputfile.ext

   incase of multiple seeders, repeat the arguments with -p option.

4. Once the file sharing is completed, appropriate message will be printed at console. In case of any error, the program will be terminated
   with appropriate error messages.
